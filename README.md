# New-Lands-RPG-
This is a text-based resource collection/adventure/PVE game coded in Python. This is the first game I have ever made, there are lots of things I want to add but don't know when I will add or even finish them. 

Feel Free to leave any issues or ideas you might have!


Planned Features:
- Make it so items that are sold give something in return.
- Make selling items quicker or in larger quantities
- make bank only hold Coins - COMPLETED
- Make a story. Why are you there, what are you doing?
